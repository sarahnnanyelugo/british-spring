          <h1>Why British Spring</h1>
          <p>
            In an era when the internal and external evaluation of public
            schools often focuses on student test scores at the expense of a
            well-rounded student experience, British Spring remains steadfast in
            supporting students to build a 9-12 ladder to college and career
            readiness that also emphasizes unique and memorable extra-curricular
            experiences. By expanding our focus beyond what students learn in
            the classroom, British Spring students acquire interpersonal and
            social emotional skills that builds their confidence to excel inside
            and outside traditional academic spaces.

            We know that every Birmingham student has incredible potential to
            impact the world, so we are determined to help them become the best
            version of themselves and to identify and build upon their
            strengths. Keeping this in mind, we have developed several support
            systems to assist students on their journey to graduation.{" "}

                    Each student is provided with a Chromebook to use duing

                    current educational technology and teachers work with
                    students to ensure they have the skills they will need after
                    graduation. The IT department and Instructional Technology

                    for students to become tech proficient.
